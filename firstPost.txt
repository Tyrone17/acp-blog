Because of you,
I gotta get it from u' ekseni,
Because of you,
I gotta pack it in my Danny,
Because of you,
I have to fake it till I make it,
Because of you,
I have to stay chomping at the bit,
Because of you,
You do you and for the rest of us its of 'sjoe',
Sickening me still how we sent off ou 'Shoes',
All we had to was to think further than 2,
Maar neh, you en yours is mos te cool, 
Because of you,
I know that I am a fool, 
But blue check; matter-of-fact,
Because of me cumming to my censenus,
I learned that my lack of good fats,
Has alot to do me trying to make sense,
For your part, what the kak was I thinking,
You unblinking, 
Never flinching, except when you stitching,
Gave me old rope, 
Another man would have knotted it - the end - but nope,
You fuck me over and over like a nympho, 
And when I ask why you claim,
Because of me,
